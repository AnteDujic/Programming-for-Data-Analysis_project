# PROGRAMMING FOR DATA ANALYSIS | PROJECT | 2021/2022
### AUTHOR: ANTE DUJIC
***

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook *bmi_ireland.ipynb*, done as a project for Programming for Data Analysis module on GMIT, Ireland. It also contains this README file with an overview of the mentioned notebook and *requirements.txt* file with a list of necessary libraries to run this project.

### HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT?

1. Clone the repository from the [GitHub](https://github.com/AnteDujic/Programming-for-Data-Analysis_project)
2. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
3. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net/)
4. Run Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
5. Open notebook in Jupyter

### NOTEBOOK OVERVIEW

The aim of this project is to show a step by step simulation of a dataset of BMI and Alcohol consumption in Ireland. Ireland has one of the highest levels of obesity in Europe, with 60% of adults and over one in five children and young people living with overweight and obesity. [17] Alcohol consumption is often linked to a high weight. Average BMI is increased with an increased level of alcohol consumption in men and women. [4] 
The data is modeled and synthesised using numpy.random package in Python. Notebook is separated into the three sections. First section is a Research section, where I'll explain what each variable represents and it's real life properties. In second section, Simulation, I will simulate each of the variables based on the research done. Data Analysis is the last section and here I will analyse the generated database and see if and how it reflects the real life.
