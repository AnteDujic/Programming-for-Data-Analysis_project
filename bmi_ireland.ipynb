    "This notebook contains a step by step simulated dataset of a relationship between BMI and Alcohol consumption in Ireland. The data is modeled and synthesised using *numpy.random* package in Python. \n",

    "Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. [1]  It is widely used to diagnose whether individuals are underweight, overweight, or obese. [2] Alcohol consumption is often linked to a high weight. Drinking more than seven times per week was associated with increased risk of weight gain and development of overweight and obesity. [3] Average BMI is increased with an increased level of alcohol consumption in men and women. [4] The goal of this project is to show how to simulate the data based on a real life reasearch. The variables that are simulated are:\n",
